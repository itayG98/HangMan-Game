HangMan UWP Game

I made a simple UWP Windows Desktop App using one C# and .Net framwork
I created a class for the game , A text file from the internet with 500 english names and constructed a XAML page
divided into three main parts : Hangman draw , the game ststus and a virtual keyboard .
My game response also to keyboard pressing.
